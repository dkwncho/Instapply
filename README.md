# Instapply
Instapply is a minimalistic, no-bs platform designed to help you find internships as soon as they are posted, sending you to the top of the resume pile. 

Instapply collects internship postings directly from the same ATS systems used by recruiters and hiring managers, which have no user-friendly search features for the typical job seeker. With hundreds or even thousands of applicants for every position, being among the first to apply can greatly increase your chances of landing that interview.
